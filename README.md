## 🚀 How to Play

- Objective: Merge tiles to reach higher numbers before time runs out.

- Use the arrow keys to move all tiles in one direction.
- When two tiles with the same number touch, they combine.
- Complete each target (32 → 64 → 128 …) within the time limit.
- New time will be asked after each successful stage.
- The challenge ends either when time runs out or you complete all stages.
